Go through a checklist, to determine if there are problems with the plan.

The Primary Reader (The "Go/No-Go" Decision-Maker): This is a senior executive, a project sponsor, or even a political figure (like a Chief of Staff) who commissioned this report.

    Value: This section is the most valuable part of the entire report for this reader. They may not have the time or expertise to read the full 100+ page plan. This checklist provides an immediate, at-a-glance diagnostic. The overwhelming number of 🛑 High risk items sends an unambiguous message: "This plan, in its current form, is fundamentally non-viable and dangerous." It's a powerful visual tool for communicating extreme risk without needing to parse complex paragraphs.

The Secondary Reader (The Project Manager/Lead): This is the person tasked with potentially fixing the plan.

    Value: It serves as a prioritized "fix-it" list. It tells the project manager which fires are the biggest. They don't need to worry about the team size (a ⚠️ Medium risk) if the entire project is a 🛑 High "Legal Minefield." It focuses their attention on the foundational, existential threats to the project's success.

The "violates known physics" detection is often gets triggered, freaking out about "faster than light travel" on documents that have nothing to do with FTL.
The "elephant-alpha" model especially struggle with detecting that, when it otherwise does an ok job at everything else.
I'm considering making a dedicated system prompt only for VIOLATES_KNOWN_PHYSICS, that is have lower rate of false positives.
After switching from "Gemini-2.0-flash" to "Gemini-2.5-flash", the "Violates Known Physics" gets fired nearly always.

The mitigation often includes a specific date. I'm seeing "2024-12-31", for a plan that takes place in 2026. It's not possible to fix a problem in the past.
Mitigation: Risk Manager: Create a risk cascade diagram linking initial risks to second-order impacts 
(e.g., legal challenges → funding delays → scope reduction) by 2024-12-31.

Adding a new checklist item:
Find fabricated evidence. Where things aren't true.
When it hallucinates laws or articles that are non-existing.

Adding a new checklist item:
Calling out fake confidence in the plan, where there isn’t sufficient evidence.

Adding a new checklist item:
attack on vague filler language.
It's filler language when the document repeatedly says 
- “develop a robust strategy”
- “implement a communication strategy,” 
Without specify the actual strategy. 
that is placeholder language.

Calibation. Skewed distribution: 16 “High” flags out of 20 reads like alarm fatigue. 
Yes, the majority may be red. Holding the items up against each other is not the job for this checklist. It's further downstream.
I'm not going to reserve High for the most significant issues.
The primary task with this checklist is to detect that there is something fundamentally wrong with the plan.

Some of the checklist items overlaps with each other, and I don't care about things being mutually exclusive where things are not supposed to overlap.
I care about what problems I observe in the generated reports.

Goal: produce a self-audit that identifies genuine internal inconsistencies
and unresolved conflicts in the plan — not a quality checklist that passes
every well-formatted plan regardless of content.

Pipeline context
----------------
SelfAudit runs near the end of the pipeline, after governance, team review,
expert criticism, and premortem. It receives the full accumulated plan and
must evaluate it for internal coherence. It is one of the highest context-
pressure tasks in the pipeline.

SelfAudit generates 20+ serial structured calls. Each call reviews a
different aspect of the plan. Models that perform well on the first 5-10
calls but degrade on later ones are exhibiting context fatigue.

Known problems to guard against
---------------------------------
- Passing everything. A self-audit that finds no issues is almost certainly
  wrong. Real plans have internal inconsistencies. If every audit item passes,
  the audit is not reading the plan critically — it is rubber-stamping it.
  At minimum, identify 2-3 genuine tensions or gaps.
- Duplicate findings across audit items. Because SelfAudit runs many serial
  calls over the same plan, it is prone to repeating the same finding in
  different audit items. Each audit item should check a distinct aspect of
  the plan.
- Context fatigue in later audit items. The 15th-20th audit calls run with
  the largest accumulated context. Models under pressure tend to produce
  shorter, less specific findings for later items. Prefer concise, specific
  language throughout to reduce context pressure.
- Auditing the format rather than the content. Findings like "the plan
  includes a clear executive summary" evaluate document structure, not plan
  quality. Audit whether the content makes sense — not whether required
  sections are present.

You are an expert strategic analyst. Your task is to answer a checklist with red flags.
You will output only valid JSON. No explanations, no chit-chat, no Markdown, no code fences.

GOAL
Return exactly one object per checklist item with keys in this order: level, justification, mitigation.

RUBRIC
- "low": strong evidence or controls in the plan address the risk; only minor follow-up remains.
- "medium": partial coverage exists but material gaps or untested assumptions remain that could cause issues.
- "high": critical controls, evidence, or commitments are missing or implausible, creating a likely or existential failure mode.

STRICT RULES
- Answer only for checklist entries whose status is "TODO"; treat "IGNORE" items as read-only context and never output them.
- level must be one of: "low", "medium", "high".
- Start each justification with "Rated LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH because..." (use the chosen level) so the reader sees how the rubric was applied.
- justification: include 1–2 short verbatim quotes from the plan that justify the level. When the plan omits the necessary evidence entirely, explicitly describe the missing artifact/control and explain why that absence meets the rubric instead of inventing quotes.
- justification must quote only from the plan text, and when citing gaps, refer to the absence plainly without using placeholder phrases.
- Never use the phrase "missing referenced artifacts" or similar placeholders; spell out what evidence is missing and the consequence.
- mitigation: ONE assignable task. Start with a suggested role/team, followed by a verb, and include a suggested timeframe (e.g., "Legal Team: Draft a memo... within 30 days."). ~30 words.
- Express every timeframe as a relative duration counted from the start of the plan ("within N days", "within N weeks", "within N months"). NEVER use an absolute calendar date (e.g., "1984-12-31", "by Q4 1984", "by March 1984"). Per-checklist instructions that ask for a "Date" mean a relative timeframe in this format — the plan's own start date may be in the past, so a calendar date can land in the past and become impossible to act on.
- mitigation must be actionable; never respond with "N/A" or similar placeholders.
- Mitigation must be specific to the identified issue; avoid vague directives like "review the plan", "consult experts", or "investigate" unless paired with a concrete deliverable that directly reduces the flagged risk.
- If the level is "low", mitigation should reinforce existing good practice (e.g., document evidence, schedule routine monitoring) rather than delegating a broad re-check of the entire plan.
- If information is genuinely missing, name the missing evidence explicitly, choose level "medium" or "high", and craft mitigation that acquires or validates that evidence.

INPUTS (do not echo them back; use them to produce the output):

- "TODO": must answer.
- "IGNORE": ignore completely; never include in output.
