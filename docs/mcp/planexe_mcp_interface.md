# PlanExe MCP Interface Specification (v1.0)

## 1. Purpose

### 1.1 What is PlanExe

PlanExe is a service that generates **strategic project-plan drafts** from a natural-language prompt. You describe a large goal (e.g. open a clinic, launch a product, build a moon base)—the kind of project that in reality takes months or years. PlanExe produces a structured draft with 20+ sections: steps, documents, and deliverables. The plan is not executable in its current form; it is a draft to refine and act on. Creating a plan is a long-running task (100+ LLM inference calls): create a task with a prompt, poll status, then download the HTML report and zip when done.

### 1.2 What kind of plan does it create

The plan is a **project plan**: a DAG of steps (Luigi tasks) that produce artifacts including a Gantt chart, risk analysis, and other project management deliverables. The main output is a self-contained interactive HTML report (~700KB) with collapsible sections, interactive Gantt charts, and embedded JavaScript. The report contains 20+ sections including executive summary, investor pitch, project plan with SMART criteria, strategic decision analysis, scenario comparison, assumptions with expert review, governance structure, SWOT analysis, team role profiles, simulated expert criticism, work breakdown structure, plan review, Q&A, premortem with failure scenarios, self-audit checklist, and adversarial premise attacks. There is also a zip file containing all intermediary pipeline files (md, json, csv) that fed the report. Plan quality depends on prompt quality; use the prompt_examples tool to see the baseline before calling plan_create.

#### 1.2.1 Agent-facing summary (for server instructions / tool descriptions)

Implementors should expose the following to agents so they understand what PlanExe does:

- **What:** PlanExe turns a plain-English goal into a strategic project-plan draft (20+ sections) in ~10–20 min. Sections include executive summary, interactive Gantt charts, investor pitch, SWOT, governance, team profiles, work breakdown, scenario comparison, expert criticism, and adversarial sections (premortem, self-audit, premise attacks) that stress-test the plan. The output is a draft to refine, not an executable or final document — but it surfaces hard questions the prompter may not have considered.
- **Required interaction order:** Call `prompt_examples` first. Optional before `plan_create`: call `model_profiles` to inspect profile guidance and available models in each profile. Then complete a non-tool step: formulate a detailed prompt as flowing prose (not structured markdown), typically ~300-800 words, using the examples as a baseline; include objective, scope, constraints, timeline, stakeholders, budget/resources, and success criteria; get user approval. Only after approval, call `plan_create`. Then poll `plan_status` (about every 5 minutes); use `plan_download` (mcp_local helper) or `plan_file_info` (mcp_cloud tool) when complete (`pending`/`processing` = keep polling, `completed` = download now, `failed` = terminal). If a task fails and the caller wants another attempt for the same `task_id`, call `plan_retry` (optional `model_profile`, default `baseline`). To stop, call `plan_stop` with the `task_id` from `plan_create`.
- **Output:** Self-contained interactive HTML report (~700KB) with collapsible sections and interactive Gantt charts — open in a browser. The zip contains the intermediary pipeline files (md, json, csv) that fed the report.

### 1.3 Scope of this document

This document specifies a Model Context Protocol (MCP) interface for PlanExe that enables AI agents and client UIs to:

1. Create and run long-running plan generation workflows.
2. Receive real-time progress updates (task status, log output).
3. List, read, and edit artifacts produced in an output directory.
4. Stop and resume execution with Luigi-aware incremental recomputation.

The interface is designed to support:

- interactive "build systems" behavior (like make / bazel),
- resumable DAG execution (Luigi),
- deterministic artifact management.

---

## 2. Goals

### 2.1 Functional goals

- Task-based orchestration: each run is associated with a task ID.
- Long-running execution: starts asynchronously; clients poll or subscribe to events.
- Artifact-first workflow: outputs are exposed as file-like artifacts.
- Stop / Resume with minimal recompute:
  - on resume, only invalidated downstream tasks regenerate.
- Progress reporting:
  - progress_percentage
- Editable artifacts:
  - user edits a generated file
  - pipeline continues from that point, producing dependent outputs

### 2.2 Non-functional goals

- Idempotency: repeated tool calls should not corrupt state.
- Observability: logs, state transitions, and artifacts must be inspectable.
- Concurrency safety: prevent conflicting writes and illegal resume patterns.
- Extensibility: future versions can add task graph browsing, caching backends, exports.

---

## 3. Non-goals

- Defining PlanExe's internal plan schema, content format, or prompt strategy.
- Providing remote code execution inside artifacts.
- Implementing a full Luigi UI clone in MCP v1 (optional later).
- Guaranteeing ETA estimates (allowed but must be optional / best-effort).

### 3.1 MCP tools vs MCP tasks ("Run as task")

The MCP specification defines two different mechanisms:

- **MCP tools** (e.g. plan_create, plan_status, plan_stop, plan_retry): the server exposes named tools; the client calls them and receives a response. PlanExe's interface is **tool-based**: the agent calls plan_create → receives task_id → polls plan_status → optionally calls plan_retry on failed → uses plan_file_info (and optionally plan_download via mcp_local). This document specifies those tools.
- **MCP tasks protocol** ("Run as task" in some UIs): a separate mechanism where the client can run a tool "as a task" using RPC methods such as tasks/run, tasks/get, tasks/result, tasks/cancel, tasks/list, so the tool runs in the background and the client polls for results.

PlanExe **does not** use or advertise the MCP tasks protocol. Implementors and clients should use the **tools only**. Do not enable "Run as task" for PlanExe; many clients (e.g. Cursor) and the Python MCP SDK do not support the tasks protocol properly. Intended flow: call `prompt_examples`; optionally call `model_profiles`; perform the non-tool prompt drafting/approval step; call `plan_create`; poll `plan_status`; if failed call `plan_retry` (optional); then call `plan_file_info` (or `plan_download` via mcp_local) when completed.

---

## 4. System Model

### 4.1 Core entities

#### Task

A long-lived container for a PlanExe project run.

**Key properties**

- task_id: UUID returned by plan_create for that task. Each plan_create returns a new UUID. Use that exact UUID for all MCP calls; do not substitute ids from other services.
- output_dir: artifact root namespace for task
- config: immutable run configuration (models, runtime limits, Luigi params)
- created_at, updated_at

#### Execution

A single execution attempt inside a task.

**Key properties**

- state: pending | processing | completed | failed
- progress_percentage: computed progress percentage (float)
- started_at, ended_at

#### Artifact

A file-like output managed by PlanExe.

**Key properties**

- path: path relative to task output root
- size, updated_at
- content_type: text/markdown, text/html, application/json, etc.
- sha256: content hash for optimistic locking and invalidation

#### Event

A typed message emitted during execution for UI/agent consumption.

**Key properties**

- cursor: ordering token
- ts: timestamp
- type: event type
- data: event payload

---

## 5. State Machine

### 5.1 TaskItem.state values

The public MCP `state` field is aligned with `TaskItem.state`:

- pending (queued, waiting for a worker)
- processing (picked up by a worker)
- completed
- failed

### 5.2 Allowed transitions

- pending → processing when picked up by a worker
- processing → completed via normal success
- processing → failed via error
- failed → pending when `plan_retry` is accepted

### 5.3 Invalid transitions

- completed → processing (new run must be triggered by creating a new task)
- processing → processing is not a state transition on the same task; create separate tasks for parallel work.

---

## 6. MCP Tools (v1 Required)

All tool names below are normative.

### 6.1 prompt_examples

**Call this first.** Returns example prompts that define the baseline for what a good prompt looks like. Do not call plan_create yet. Correct flow: call this tool; optionally call `model_profiles`; then complete a non-tool step (draft and approve a detailed prompt, typically ~300-800 words); only then call `plan_create`. If you call `plan_create` before formulating and approving a prompt, the resulting plan will be lower quality than it could be.

Write the prompt as flowing prose, not structured markdown with headers or bullet lists. Weave technical specs, constraints, and targets naturally into sentences. Include banned words/approaches and governance structure inline. Typical length: 300–800 words. The examples demonstrate this prose style — match their tone and density.

**Request:** no parameters (empty object).

**Response:**

```json
{
  "samples": ["prompt text 1", "prompt text 2", "..."],
  "message": "..."
}
```

---

### 6.1.1 model_profiles

Optional helper tool to discover valid `model_profile` choices and currently available models without relying on internal config knowledge.
Profiles with zero available models are omitted from the returned `profiles` array.
If no models are available in any profile, the tool returns `isError=true` with `error.code = MODEL_PROFILES_UNAVAILABLE`.

**Request:** no parameters (empty object).

**Response (shape)**

```json
{
  "default_profile": "baseline",
  "profiles": [
    {
      "profile": "baseline",
      "title": "Baseline",
      "summary": "Cheap and fast; recommended default when creating a plan.",
      "model_count": 5,
      "models": [
        {
          "key": "openrouter-gpt-oss-20b",
          "provider_class": "OpenRouter",
          "model": "openai/gpt-oss-20b",
          "priority": 0
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "message": "..."
}
```

Use the returned `profile` values directly in `plan_create.model_profile`.

---

### 6.2 plan_create

**Call only after prompt_examples and after the non-tool drafting/approval step.** Start creating a new plan with the approved prompt.

**Request**

**Schema**

```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "prompt": { "type": "string" },
    "model_profile": {
      "type": "string",
      "enum": ["baseline", "premium", "frontier", "custom"],
      "default": "baseline"
    },
    "user_api_key": { "type": "string" }
  },
  "required": ["prompt"]
}
```

**Example**

```json
{
  "prompt": "string",
  "model_profile": "baseline",
  "user_api_key": "pex_..."
}
```

**Prompt quality**

The `prompt` parameter should be a detailed description of what the plan should cover. Good prompts are typically 300-800 words and include:

- Objective
- Scope
- Constraints
- Timeline
- Stakeholders
- Budget/resources
- Success criteria

Write as flowing prose, not structured markdown. Include banned approaches, governance preferences, and phasing inline. Short one-liners (e.g., "Construct a bridge") tend to produce poor output because they lack context for the planning pipeline. Important details are location, budget, time frame.

**Counterexamples: when NOT to use PlanExe**

Use a normal single LLM response (not PlanExe) for one-shot micro-tasks. PlanExe runs a heavy multi-step planning pipeline and is best for substantial project planning.

- Bad (do not send to plan_create): "Give me a 5-point checklist for launching a coffee shop."
- Better non-PlanExe action: ask the LLM directly for a checklist.
- Better PlanExe prompt: "Create a 12-month strategic launch plan for a coffee shop in Austin with budget caps, lease milestones, hiring plan, permits, supply chain, marketing channels, risk register, governance, and success KPIs."

- Bad (do not send to plan_create): "Summarize this text in 6 bullets."
- Better non-PlanExe action: use direct summarization in the chat model.

- Bad (invalid assumption): "Run only the risk-register part of PlanExe."
- Rule: PlanExe pipeline execution is fixed end-to-end. Callers cannot choose internal step subsets.
- Better PlanExe prompt: request a full plan where risk analysis is one required deliverable.

- Bad (do not send to plan_create): "Rewrite this email to sound professional."
- Better non-PlanExe action: use direct rewriting in the chat model.

**Optional**

- model_profile: LLM profile (`baseline` | `premium` | `frontier` | `custom`). If unsure, call `model_profiles` first.
- user_api_key: user API key for credits and attribution (if your deployment requires it).

Clients can call the MCP tool **prompt_examples** to retrieve example prompts. Use these as examples for plan_create; they can also call plan_create with any prompt—short prompts produce less detailed plans.

For the full catalog file:

- `worker_plan/worker_plan_api/prompt/data/simple_plan_prompts.jsonl` — JSONL with `id`, `prompt`, optional `tags`, and optional `mcp_example` (true = curated for MCP).

**Response**

```json
{
  "task_id": "5e2b2a7c-8b49-4d2f-9b8f-6a3c1f05b9a1",
  "created_at": "2026-01-14T12:34:56Z"
}
```

**Important**

- task_id is a UUID returned by plan_create. Use this exact UUID for plan_status/plan_stop/plan_retry/plan_file_info (and plan_download when using mcp_local).

**Behavior**

- Must be idempotent only if client supplies an optional client_request_id (optional extension).
- Task config is immutable after creation in v1.
- By default, repeated `plan_create` calls produce new tasks (new `task_id`s).

---

### 6.3 plan_status

Returns task status and progress. Used for progress bars and UI states. **Polling interval:** call at reasonable intervals only (e.g. every 5 minutes); plan generation typically takes 10–20 minutes (baseline profile) and may take longer on higher-quality profiles.

**Request**

```json
{
  "task_id": "5e2b2a7c-8b49-4d2f-9b8f-6a3c1f05b9a1"
}
```

**Input**

- task_id: UUID returned by plan_create. Use it to reference the plan being created.

**Caller contract (state meanings)**

- `pending`: queued and waiting for a worker. Keep polling.
- `processing`: picked up by a worker and in progress. Keep polling.
- `completed`: terminal success. Download artifacts now.
- `failed`: terminal error. Do not keep polling for completion.

**Terminal states**

- `completed`, `failed`

**Response**

```json
{
  "task_id": "5e2b2a7c-8b49-4d2f-9b8f-6a3c1f05b9a1",
  "state": "processing",
  "progress_percentage": 62.0,
  "timing": {
    "started_at": "2026-01-14T12:35:10Z",
    "elapsed_sec": 512
  },
  "files": [
    {
      "path": "plan.md",
      "updated_at": "2026-01-14T12:43:11Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Notes**

- progress_percentage must be a float within [0,100].

---

### 6.4 plan_stop

Requests the plan generation to stop. Pass the **task_id** (the UUID returned by plan_create). Call `plan_stop` with that task_id.

**Request**

```json
{
  "task_id": "5e2b2a7c-8b49-4d2f-9b8f-6a3c1f05b9a1"
}
```

**Input**

- task_id: UUID returned by plan_create. Use this same UUID when calling plan_stop to request the task to stop.

**Response**

```json
{
  "state": "processing",
  "stop_requested": true
}
```

**Required semantics**

- Must stop workers cleanly where possible.
- Must persist enough Luigi state to resume incrementally.

---

### 6.5 plan_retry

Retries a task that is currently in `failed` state.

**Request**

```json
{
  "task_id": "5e2b2a7c-8b49-4d2f-9b8f-6a3c1f05b9a1",
  "model_profile": "baseline"
}
```

**Input**

- task_id: UUID of a failed task.
- model_profile: optional (`baseline` | `premium` | `frontier` | `custom`), default `baseline`.

**Response**

```json
{
  "task_id": "5e2b2a7c-8b49-4d2f-9b8f-6a3c1f05b9a1",
  "state": "pending",
  "model_profile": "baseline",
  "retried_at": "2026-02-24T15:20:00Z"
}
```

**Required semantics**

- Only failed tasks are retryable.
- On success, the same task_id is reset to `pending` and requeued.
- Prior artifacts for that task are cleared before requeue.

**Error behavior**

- Unknown task_id: `TASK_NOT_FOUND` (`isError=true`).
- Task not failed: `TASK_NOT_FAILED` (`isError=true`).

---

### 6.6 Download flow (plan_download vs plan_file_info)

**If your client exposes plan_download** (e.g. mcp_local): use it to save the report or zip locally; it calls plan_file_info under the hood, then fetches and writes to the local save path (e.g. PLANEXE_PATH).

**If you only have plan_file_info** (e.g. direct connection to mcp_cloud): call it with task_id and artifact ("report" or "zip"); use the returned download_url to fetch the file (e.g. GET with API key if configured).

**plan_file_info input**

- task_id: UUID returned by plan_create. Use it to download the created plan.
- artifact: "report" or "zip" (default "report").

**plan_download local path behavior (mcp_local)**

- Save directory is `PLANEXE_PATH`.
- If `PLANEXE_PATH` is unset, save to current working directory.
- If `PLANEXE_PATH` points to a file (not a directory), return an error.
- Filenames are `<task_id>-030-report.html` or `<task_id>-run.zip`.
- If a filename already exists, append `-1`, `-2`, ... before extension.
- Successful responses include `saved_path`.

**plan_file_info URL behavior (mcp_cloud)**

- `download_url` is an absolute URL where the requested artifact can be downloaded.

---

## 7. Targets

### 7.1 Standard targets

The following targets MUST be supported:

- build_plan
- validate_plan
- build_plan_and_validate

Targets map to Luigi "final tasks".

---

## 8. Concurrency & Locking

### 8.1 Client-side concurrency guidance

The server does not enforce a global limit on how many tasks a client can create.
Concurrency is a client-side coordination concern.

Recommended practice for MCP clients:

- Start with 1 active task.
- If needed, increase to 2 tasks in parallel.
- Going beyond 4 parallel tasks is usually hard to track; avoid unless necessary.

Additional semantics:

- Every `plan_create` call creates a new independent task with a new `task_id`.
- `plan_retry` reuses the existing failed `task_id` (it does not create a new task id).
- The server does not deduplicate “same prompt” requests into a single shared task.
- Keep your own task registry/client state if you run multiple tasks concurrently.

---

## 9. Error Model

### 9.1 Error object shape

Tool errors return:

- `error.code`: stable machine-readable string
- `error.message`: human-readable message
- `error.details`: optional object

Example:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "TASK_NOT_FOUND",
    "message": "Task not found: <task_id>"
  }
}
```

### 9.2 isError behavior

- `plan_create`, `plan_status`, `plan_stop`, `plan_retry`: unknown/invalid requests return `isError=true` with `error`.
- `model_profiles`: returns `isError=true` with `MODEL_PROFILES_UNAVAILABLE` when no models are available in any profile.
- `plan_file_info`: uses mixed behavior:
  - returns `{}` (not an error) while artifacts are not ready.
  - may return `{"error": ...}` with `isError=false` for terminal artifact-level problems.
  - returns `isError=true` for unknown task id (`TASK_NOT_FOUND`).
- `mcp_local` may return proxy/transport failures as `REMOTE_ERROR` and local download write failures as `DOWNLOAD_FAILED`.

### 9.3 Minimal code contract (current)

Cloud/core tool codes:

- `INVALID_TOOL`: unknown MCP tool name.
- `INTERNAL_ERROR`: uncaught server error.
- `TASK_NOT_FOUND`: task id not found.
- `TASK_NOT_FAILED`: plan_retry called for a task that is not in failed state.
- `INVALID_USER_API_KEY`: provided user_api_key is invalid.
- `USER_API_KEY_REQUIRED`: deployment requires user_api_key for plan_create.
- `INSUFFICIENT_CREDITS`: caller account has no credits for plan_create.
- `MODEL_PROFILES_UNAVAILABLE`: model_profiles found zero available models across all profiles.
- `generation_failed`: plan_file_info report path when task ended in failed.
- `content_unavailable`: plan_file_info cannot read requested artifact bytes.

Local proxy specific codes:

- `REMOTE_ERROR`: mcp_local could not call mcp_cloud (network/HTTP/protocol layer failure).
- `DOWNLOAD_FAILED`: mcp_local could not write/download artifact to local filesystem.

### 9.4 Caller handling guidance

- Retry with backoff:
  - `INTERNAL_ERROR`
  - `REMOTE_ERROR`
  - `content_unavailable` (short retry window)
- Do not retry unchanged request:
  - `INVALID_USER_API_KEY`
  - `USER_API_KEY_REQUIRED`
  - `INSUFFICIENT_CREDITS`
  - `INVALID_TOOL`
- For `TASK_NOT_FAILED`: call `plan_retry` only after `plan_status.state == failed`.
- For `TASK_NOT_FOUND`: verify task_id source and stop polling that id.
- For `generation_failed`: treat as terminal failure and surface task progress_message to user.

---

## 10. Security & Isolation

### 10.1 Sandbox constraints

- All artifacts must live under task-scoped storage.
- Artifact URIs must not permit path traversal.

### 10.2 Access control

At minimum:

- task must be scoped to a user identity (metadata.user_id)
- callers without permission must receive PERMISSION_DENIED

### 10.3 Sensitive data handling

- logs may include model prompts/responses → treat logs as sensitive artifacts
- allow a config option to redact prompt content in event streaming

### 10.4 Authentication mode

- MCP authentication is API-key header based.
- Clients should send `X-API-Key: pex_...` on MCP requests.
- OAuth is not supported for the MCP API.

---

## 11. Performance Requirements

### 11.1 Responsiveness

- plan_status must return within < 250ms under normal load.

### 11.2 Large artifacts

- server SHOULD impose max read size per call (e.g., 2–10MB)

---

## 12. Observability Requirements

The server MUST persist:

- run lifecycle events
- stop reasons
- failure tracebacks as artifacts (e.g., run_error.json)
- luigi execution logs (run.log)

---

## 13. Reference UI Integration Contract

To match your UI behavior:

**Progress bars**

Use:

- plan_status.progress_percentage
- or progress_updated events

---

## 14. Compatibility & Versioning

### 14.1 Versioning strategy

- MCP server exposes: planexe.version = "1.0"
- breaking changes require major bump

### 14.2 Forward compatibility

Clients must ignore unknown fields and unknown event types.

---

## 15. Testing Strategy

### 15.1 Contract tests (required)

- Start/stop/resume loops
- Invalid transition errors
- Event cursor monotonicity

### 15.2 Determinism tests (recommended)

- Given same inputs + same edits, ensure same downstream artifacts unless models are stochastic
- If models are stochastic, test pipeline correctness, not identical bytes

### 15.3 Load tests (recommended)

- multiple tasks concurrently, one run each
- event streaming stability under heavy log output

---

## 16. Future Extensions (MCP Resources)

PlanExe is artifact-first, and MCP already has a native concept for that: resources. Today artifacts are exposed via download_url or via proxy download + saved_path. Future versions SHOULD expose artifacts as MCP resources so clients can fetch them via standard resource reads (and treat PlanExe as a first-class MCP server rather than a thin API wrapper).

**Proposed resource identifiers**

- planexe://task/<task_id>/report
- planexe://task/<task_id>/zip

**Recommended resource metadata**

- mime type (content_type)
- size (bytes)
- sha256 (content hash)
- generated_at (UTC timestamp)

**Notes**

- Resources can be backed by existing HTTP endpoints internally; the MCP resource read returns the bytes + metadata.
- This enables richer MCP client UX (preview, caching, validation) without custom tool calls.

---

## 17. Future Tools (High-Leverage, Low-Complexity)

The following tools remove common UX friction without expanding the core model.

### 17.1 plan_list (or task_recent)

Return a short list of recent tasks so agents can recover if they lost a task_id.

**Notes**

- Default limit: 5–10 tasks.
- Include task_id, created_at, state, and prompt summary.

### 17.2 task_wait

Blocking helper that polls internally until the task completes or times out. Returns the final plan_status payload plus suggested next steps.

**Notes**

- Inputs: task_id, timeout_sec (optional), poll_interval_sec (optional).
- Outputs: same as plan_status + next_steps (string or list).

### 17.3 task_get_latest

Simplest recovery: return the most recently created task for the caller.

**Notes**

- Useful for single-user / single-session flows.
- Should be scoped to the caller/user_id when available.

### 17.4 task_logs_tail (optional)

Return the tail of recent log lines for troubleshooting failures.

**Notes**

- Inputs: task_id, max_lines (optional), since_cursor (optional).
- Useful when plan_status shows failed but no context.

---

## Appendix B — Optional v1.1 Extensions

If you want richer Luigi integration later:

- planexe.task.graph (nodes + edges + states)
- planexe.task.invalidate (rerun subtree)
- planexe.export.bundle (zip all artifacts)
- planexe.validate.only (audit without regeneration)
- planexe.task.archive (freeze task)
