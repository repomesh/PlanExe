# Using PlanExe with LM Studio

This is for **advanced users** that already have PlanExe working. If you're new to PlanExe, start with [OpenRouter](openrouter.md) instead.

[LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai/) is an open source app for macOS, Windows, and Linux for running LLMs on your own computer. It is useful for local troubleshooting.

PlanExe processes more text than regular chat. You will need capable hardware to run an LLM at a reasonable speed.

## Quickstart (Docker)

1. Install LM Studio on your host and download a small model inside LM Studio (e.g. `Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-1M`, ~4.5 GB).
2. Copy `.env.docker-example` to `.env` (even if you leave keys empty for LM Studio) and use the `lmstudio-...` entry in `llm_config/<profile>.json`, setting `base_url` to `http://host.docker.internal:1234` (Docker Desktop) or your Linux bridge IP.
3. Start PlanExe: `docker compose up worker_plan frontend_multi_user`. Open http://localhost:5001, submit a prompt, and watch `docker compose logs -f worker_plan` for progress.

### Host-only (no Docker)

For advanced users: use the host entry (e.g. `"lmstudio-qwen2.5-7b-instruct-1m"`) in `llm_config/<profile>.json` so `base_url` stays on `http://127.0.0.1:1234`. Start your preferred PlanExe runner (e.g. a local Python environment) and ensure the LM Studio server is running before you submit jobs.

## Configuration

In `llm_config/<profile>.json`, find a config that starts with `lmstudio-` (e.g. `"lmstudio-qwen2.5-7b-instruct-1m"`). In LM Studio, find the model with that exact id and download it. The Qwen model is on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/lmstudio-community/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-1M-GGUF) (~4.5 GB).

In LM Studio, go to the **Developer** page (Cmd+2 / Ctrl+2 / Windows+2), start the server, and confirm the UI shows **Status: Running** and **Reachable at: http://127.0.0.1:1234**.

### Minimum viable setup

- Start with a ~7B model (≈5 GB download). Expect workable speeds on a 16 GB RAM laptop or a GPU with ≥8 GB VRAM; larger models slow sharply without more hardware.
- Structured output matters: not all models return clean structured output. If you see malformed or JSON errors, try a nearby model or quantization.

### Run LM Studio locally with Docker

Containers cannot reach `127.0.0.1` on your host. Set `base_url` in `llm_config/<profile>.json` to `http://host.docker.internal:1234` (Docker Desktop) or your Docker bridge IP on Linux (often `http://172.17.0.1:1234`). On Linux, add `extra_hosts: ["host.docker.internal:host-gateway"]` under `worker_plan` in `docker-compose.yml` if that hostname is missing.

To find your bridge IP on Linux:

```bash
ip addr show docker0 | awk '/inet /{print $2}'
```

If `docker0` is missing (e.g. with Podman or alternate bridge names), inspect the default bridge gateway:

```bash
docker network inspect bridge | awk -F'"' '/Gateway/{print $4}'
```

Example `llm_config/<profile>.json` entry (add `base_url` when using Docker):

```json
"lmstudio-qwen2.5-7b-instruct-1m": {
    "comment": "Runs via LM Studio on the host; PlanExe in Docker points to the host LM Studio server.",
    "class": "LMStudio",
    "arguments": {
        "model_name": "qwen2.5-7b-instruct-1m",
        "base_url": "http://host.docker.internal:1234/v1",
        "temperature": 0.2,
        "request_timeout": 120.0,
        "is_function_calling_model": false
    }
}
```

After editing `llm_config/<profile>.json`, rebuild or restart the worker and frontends: `docker compose up worker_plan frontend_multi_user` (add `--build` or run `docker compose build worker_plan frontend_multi_user` if the image needs the new config).

## Troubleshooting

When you click **Submit** in PlanExe, a new output directory is created containing `log.txt`. Open that file and scroll to the bottom for error messages.

Report issues on [Discord](https://planexe.org/discord). Include system info (e.g. “I’m on macOS with M1 Max, 64 GB”).

**Where to look for logs:**

- **Host filesystem:** `run/<timestamped-output-dir>/log.txt` (mounted from the container).
- **Container logs:** `docker compose logs -f worker_plan` (watch for connection errors to LM Studio).
- **Structured-output failures:** If you see JSON/parse errors or malformed output in `log.txt`, try a different model or quantization; not all models return structured output cleanly.

## Run LM Studio on a remote computer

Use a secure tunnel instead of exposing the server directly. From your local machine:

```bash
ssh -N -L 1234:localhost:1234 user@remote-host
```

Then set `base_url` to `http://localhost:1234` while the tunnel is running.

## Thinking Tokens and Reasoning Content

Some advanced models (like Qwen3.5 with extended thinking) can be configured in LM Studio to emit **thinking tokens** — internal chain-of-thought reasoning that doesn't appear in the final output.

### The Gotcha

When thinking tokens are enabled:
- The model may return `reasoning_content` (internal reasoning) but `content: null` (final output empty)
- llama_index's standard `OpenAILike` class only reads `content`, causing a crash if it's None

### Solution

Use the `ThinkingAwareOpenAILike` class instead of `OpenAILike` in your config:

```json
"lmstudio-qwen3.5-9b-with-thinking": {
    "class": "ThinkingAwareOpenAILike",
    "arguments": {
        "model": "qwen/qwen3.5-9b",
        "api_base": "http://127.0.0.1:1234/v1",
        "api_key": "lm-studio",
        "temperature": 0.55,
        "timeout": 600.0,
        "is_function_calling_model": false,
        "is_chat_model": true,
        "context_window": 32768,
        "max_tokens": 4096,
        "should_use_structured_outputs": true
    }
}
```

`ThinkingAwareOpenAILike` safely handles both:
1. **With thinking:** Falls back to `reasoning_content` if `content` is null
2. **Without thinking:** Works exactly like `OpenAILike` for normal responses

### Best Practice

If you're enabling thinking in LM Studio (e.g., via the Developer preset), always use `ThinkingAwareOpenAILike` to avoid crashes. See [issue #228](https://github.com/PlanExeOrg/PlanExe/pull/228) for technical details.
