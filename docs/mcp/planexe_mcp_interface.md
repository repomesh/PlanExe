# PlanExe MCP Interface Specification (v1.0)

## 1. Purpose

### 1.1 What is PlanExe

PlanExe is a service that generates **rough-draft project plans** from a natural-language prompt. You describe a large goal (e.g. open a clinic, launch a product, build a moon base)—the kind of project that in reality takes months or years. PlanExe produces a structured draft: steps, documents, and deliverables. The plan is not executable in its current form; it is a draft to refine and act on. Creating a plan is a long-running task (100+ LLM inference calls): create a task with a prompt, poll status, then download the HTML report and zip when done.

### 1.2 What kind of plan does it create

The plan is a **project plan**: a DAG of steps (Luigi tasks) that produce artifacts including a Gantt chart, risk analysis, and other project management deliverables. The main output is a large HTML file (approx 700KB) containing many sections. There is also a zip file containing all intermediary files (md, json, csv). Plan quality depends on prompt quality; use the prompt_examples tool to see the baseline before calling task_create.

#### 1.2.1 Agent-facing summary (for server instructions / tool descriptions)

Implementors should expose the following to agents so they understand what PlanExe does:

- **What:** PlanExe turns a plain-English goal into a structured strategic-plan draft (executive summary, Gantt, risk register, governance, etc.) in ~15–20 min. The plan is a draft to refine, not an executable or final document.
- **Required interaction order:** Step 1 — Call prompt_examples to fetch example prompts. Optional before task_create: call model_profiles to inspect profile guidance and available models under current whitelist settings. Step 2 — Formulate a good prompt (use examples as a baseline; similar structure; get user approval). Step 3 — Only then call task_create with the approved prompt. Then poll task_status; use task_download or task_file_info when complete (`pending`/`processing` = keep polling, `completed` = download now, `failed` = terminal). To stop, call task_stop with the task_id from task_create.
- **Output:** Large HTML report (~700KB) and optional zip of intermediate files (md, json, csv).

### 1.3 Scope of this document

This document specifies a Model Context Protocol (MCP) interface for PlanExe that enables AI agents and client UIs to:

1. Create and run long-running plan generation workflows.
2. Receive real-time progress updates (task status, log output).
3. List, read, and edit artifacts produced in an output directory.
4. Stop and resume execution with Luigi-aware incremental recomputation.

The interface is designed to support:

- interactive "build systems" behavior (like make / bazel),
- resumable DAG execution (Luigi),
- deterministic artifact management.

---

## 2. Goals

### 2.1 Functional goals

- Task-based orchestration: each run is associated with a task ID.
- Long-running execution: starts asynchronously; clients poll or subscribe to events.
- Artifact-first workflow: outputs are exposed as file-like artifacts.
- Stop / Resume with minimal recompute:
  - on resume, only invalidated downstream tasks regenerate.
- Progress reporting:
  - progress_percentage
- Editable artifacts:
  - user edits a generated file
  - pipeline continues from that point, producing dependent outputs

### 2.2 Non-functional goals

- Idempotency: repeated tool calls should not corrupt state.
- Observability: logs, state transitions, and artifacts must be inspectable.
- Concurrency safety: prevent conflicting writes and illegal resume patterns.
- Extensibility: future versions can add task graph browsing, caching backends, exports.

---

## 3. Non-goals

- Defining PlanExe's internal plan schema, content format, or prompt strategy.
- Providing remote code execution inside artifacts.
- Implementing a full Luigi UI clone in MCP v1 (optional later).
- Guaranteeing ETA estimates (allowed but must be optional / best-effort).

### 3.1 MCP tools vs MCP tasks ("Run as task")

The MCP specification defines two different mechanisms:

- **MCP tools** (e.g. task_create, task_status, task_stop): the server exposes named tools; the client calls them and receives a response. PlanExe's interface is **tool-based**: the agent calls task_create → receives task_id → polls task_status → uses task_download or task_file_info. This document specifies those tools.
- **MCP tasks protocol** ("Run as task" in some UIs): a separate mechanism where the client can run a tool "as a task" using RPC methods such as tasks/run, tasks/get, tasks/result, tasks/cancel, tasks/list, so the tool runs in the background and the client polls for results.

PlanExe **does not** use or advertise the MCP tasks protocol. Implementors and clients should use the **tools only**. Do not enable "Run as task" for PlanExe; many clients (e.g. Cursor) and the Python MCP SDK do not support the tasks protocol properly. The intended flow is: Step 1 — call prompt_examples; optional before task_create — call model_profiles; Step 2 — formulate a good prompt (user approval); Step 3 — call task_create; then poll task_status and call task_download or task_file_info when complete.

---

## 4. System Model

### 4.1 Core entities

#### Task

A long-lived container for a PlanExe project run.

**Key properties**

- task_id: UUID returned by task_create for that task. Each task_create returns a new UUID. Use that exact UUID for all MCP calls; do not substitute ids from other services.
- output_dir: artifact root namespace for task
- config: immutable run configuration (models, runtime limits, Luigi params)
- created_at, updated_at

#### Execution

A single execution attempt inside a task.

**Key properties**

- state: pending | processing | completed | failed
- progress_percentage: computed progress percentage (float)
- started_at, ended_at

#### Artifact

A file-like output managed by PlanExe.

**Key properties**

- path: path relative to task output root
- size, updated_at
- content_type: text/markdown, text/html, application/json, etc.
- sha256: content hash for optimistic locking and invalidation

#### Event

A typed message emitted during execution for UI/agent consumption.

**Key properties**

- cursor: ordering token
- ts: timestamp
- type: event type
- data: event payload

---

## 5. State Machine

### 5.1 TaskItem.state values

The public MCP `state` field is aligned with `TaskItem.state`:

- pending (queued, waiting for a worker)
- processing (picked up by a worker)
- completed
- failed

### 5.2 Allowed transitions

- pending → processing when picked up by a worker
- processing → completed via normal success
- processing → failed via error

### 5.3 Invalid transitions

- completed → processing (new run must be triggered by creating a new task)
- processing → processing is not a state transition on the same task; create separate tasks for parallel work.

---

## 6. MCP Tools (v1 Required)

All tool names below are normative.

### 6.1 prompt_examples

**Step 1 — Call this first.** Returns example prompts that define the baseline for what a good prompt looks like. Do not call task_create yet. Correct flow: Step 1 — call this tool to fetch examples. Step 2 — Formulate a good prompt (use examples as a baseline; similar structure; get user approval). Step 3 — Only then call task_create with the approved prompt. If you call task_create before formulating and approving a prompt, the resulting plan will be lower quality than it could be.

**Request:** no parameters (empty object).

**Response:**

```json
{
  "samples": ["prompt text 1", "prompt text 2", "..."],
  "message": "..."
}
```

---

### 6.1.1 model_profiles

Optional helper tool to discover valid `model_profile` choices and currently available models without relying on internal config knowledge.

**Request:** no parameters (empty object).

**Response (shape)**

```json
{
  "default_profile": "baseline",
  "whitelist_active": true,
  "whitelisted_classes": ["openrouter"],
  "profiles": [
    {
      "profile": "baseline",
      "title": "Baseline",
      "summary": "Cheap and fast; recommended default for most runs.",
      "config_filename": "baseline.json",
      "available": true,
      "model_count": 5,
      "filtered_out_count": 2,
      "models": [
        {
          "key": "openrouter-gpt-oss-20b",
          "provider_class": "OpenRouter",
          "model": "openai/gpt-oss-20b",
          "priority": 0
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "message": "..."
}
```

Use the returned `profile` values directly in `task_create.model_profile`.

---

### 6.2 task_create

**Step 3 — Call only after prompt_examples (Step 1) and after you have formulated a good prompt and got user approval (Step 2).** Start creating a new plan with the approved prompt.

**Request**

**Schema**

```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "prompt": { "type": "string" },
    "model_profile": {
      "type": "string",
      "enum": ["baseline", "premium", "frontier", "custom"],
      "default": "baseline"
    },
    "user_api_key": { "type": "string" }
  },
  "required": ["prompt"]
}
```

**Example**

```json
{
  "prompt": "string",
  "model_profile": "baseline",
  "user_api_key": "pex_..."
}
```

**Tool-specific metadata (developer-only, hidden from model-visible schema)**

Use tool-specific metadata when you need runtime overrides that should not be visible in the tool interface shown to AI agents.

`speed_vs_detail` is read from metadata, not from the visible input schema.

- `speed_vs_detail` accepted values:
  - `ping`: single LLM call to verify the pipeline/LLM path.
  - `fast`: reduced-detail run through the full pipeline.
  - `all`: full-detail run through the full pipeline.

**Metadata example**

```json
{
  "prompt": "string",
  "metadata": {
    "task_create": {
      "speed_vs_detail": "ping"
    }
  }
}
```

**Prompt quality**

The `prompt` parameter should be a detailed description of what the plan should cover. Good prompts are typically 300–800 words and include:

- Clear context: background, constraints, and goals
- Specific requirements: budget, timeline, location, or technical constraints
- Success criteria: what "done" looks like
- Banned words or approaches (if any)

Short one-liners (e.g., "Construct a bridge") tend to produce poor output because they lack context for the planning pipeline. Important details are location, budget, time frame.

**Counterexamples: when NOT to use PlanExe**

Use a normal single LLM response (not PlanExe) for one-shot micro-tasks. PlanExe runs a heavy multi-step planning pipeline and is best for substantial project planning.

- Bad (do not send to task_create): "Give me a 5-point checklist for launching a coffee shop."
- Better non-PlanExe action: ask the LLM directly for a checklist.
- Better PlanExe prompt: "Create a 12-month strategic launch plan for a coffee shop in Austin with budget caps, lease milestones, hiring plan, permits, supply chain, marketing channels, risk register, governance, and success KPIs."

- Bad (do not send to task_create): "Summarize this text in 6 bullets."
- Better non-PlanExe action: use direct summarization in the chat model.

- Bad (invalid assumption): "Run only the risk-register part of PlanExe."
- Rule: PlanExe pipeline execution is fixed end-to-end. Callers cannot choose internal step subsets.
- Better PlanExe prompt: request a full plan where risk analysis is one required deliverable.

- Bad (do not send to task_create): "Rewrite this email to sound professional."
- Better non-PlanExe action: use direct rewriting in the chat model.

**Optional**

- model_profile: LLM profile (`baseline` | `premium` | `frontier` | `custom`). If unsure, call `model_profiles` first.
- user_api_key: user API key for credits and attribution (if your deployment requires it).

Clients can call the MCP tool **prompt_examples** to retrieve example prompts. Use these as examples for task_create; they can also call task_create with any prompt—short prompts produce less detailed plans.

For the full catalog file:

- `worker_plan/worker_plan_api/prompt/data/simple_plan_prompts.jsonl` — JSONL with `id`, `prompt`, optional `tags`, and optional `mcp_example` (true = curated for MCP).

**Response**

```json
{
  "task_id": "5e2b2a7c-8b49-4d2f-9b8f-6a3c1f05b9a1",
  "created_at": "2026-01-14T12:34:56Z"
}
```

**Important**

- task_id is a UUID returned by task_create. Use this exact UUID for task_status/task_stop/task_download/task_file_info.

**Behavior**

- Must be idempotent only if client supplies an optional client_request_id (optional extension).
- Task config is immutable after creation in v1.

---

### 6.3 task_status

Returns task status and progress. Used for progress bars and UI states. **Polling interval:** call at reasonable intervals only (e.g. every 5 minutes); plan generation takes 15–20+ minutes and frequent polling is unnecessary.

**Request**

```json
{
  "task_id": "5e2b2a7c-8b49-4d2f-9b8f-6a3c1f05b9a1"
}
```

**Input**

- task_id: UUID returned by task_create. Use it to reference the plan being created.

**Caller contract (state meanings)**

- `pending`: queued and waiting for a worker. Keep polling.
- `processing`: picked up by a worker and in progress. Keep polling.
- `completed`: terminal success. Download artifacts now.
- `failed`: terminal error. Do not keep polling for completion.

**Terminal states**

- `completed`, `failed`

**Response**

```json
{
  "task_id": "5e2b2a7c-8b49-4d2f-9b8f-6a3c1f05b9a1",
  "state": "processing",
  "progress_percentage": 62.0,
  "timing": {
    "started_at": "2026-01-14T12:35:10Z",
    "elapsed_sec": 512
  },
  "files": [
    {
      "path": "plan.md",
      "updated_at": "2026-01-14T12:43:11Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Notes**

- progress_percentage must be a float within [0,100].

---

### 6.4 task_stop

Requests the plan generation to stop. Pass the **task_id** (the UUID returned by task_create). Call `task_stop` with that task_id.

**Request**

```json
{
  "task_id": "5e2b2a7c-8b49-4d2f-9b8f-6a3c1f05b9a1"
}
```

**Input**

- task_id: UUID returned by task_create. Use this same UUID when calling task_stop to request the task to stop.

**Response**

```json
{
  "state": "processing",
  "stop_requested": true
}
```

**Required semantics**

- Must stop workers cleanly where possible.
- Must persist enough Luigi state to resume incrementally.

---

### 6.5 Download flow (task_download vs task_file_info)

**If your client exposes task_download** (e.g. mcp_local): use it to save the report or zip locally; it calls task_file_info under the hood, then fetches and writes to the local save path (e.g. PLANEXE_PATH).

**If you only have task_file_info** (e.g. direct connection to mcp_cloud): call it with task_id and artifact ("report" or "zip"); use the returned download_url to fetch the file (e.g. GET with API key if configured).

**task_file_info input**

- task_id: UUID returned by task_create. Use it to download the created plan.
- artifact: "report" or "zip" (default "report").

**task_download local path behavior (mcp_local)**

- Save directory is `PLANEXE_PATH`.
- If `PLANEXE_PATH` is unset, save to current working directory.
- If `PLANEXE_PATH` points to a file (not a directory), return an error.
- Filenames are `<task_id>-030-report.html` or `<task_id>-run.zip`.
- If a filename already exists, append `-1`, `-2`, ... before extension.
- Successful responses include `saved_path`.

**task_file_info URL behavior (mcp_cloud)**

- `download_url` is generated from `PLANEXE_MCP_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` when set.
- Otherwise, cloud HTTP mode uses request host/scheme when available.
- If no public base URL can be determined (for example some stdio-only flows), `download_url` may be absent.
- In deployments behind proxies/CDNs, set `PLANEXE_MCP_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` so clients receive a reachable URL.

---

## 7. Targets

### 7.1 Standard targets

The following targets MUST be supported:

- build_plan
- validate_plan
- build_plan_and_validate

Targets map to Luigi "final tasks".

---

## 8. Concurrency & Locking

### 8.1 Client-side concurrency guidance

The server does not enforce a global limit on how many tasks a client can create.
Concurrency is a client-side coordination concern.

Recommended practice for MCP clients:

- Start with 1 active task.
- If needed, increase to 2 tasks in parallel.
- Going beyond 4 parallel tasks is usually hard to track; avoid unless necessary.

---

## 9. Error Model

Errors MUST return:

- code: stable machine-readable
- message: human-readable
- details: optional

**Example:**

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "RUN_ALREADY_ACTIVE",
    "message": "A run is currently active for this task.",
    "details": { "run_id": "run_0001" }
  }
}
```

### 9.1 Required error codes

- TASK_NOT_FOUND
- RUN_NOT_FOUND
- RUN_ALREADY_ACTIVE
- RUN_NOT_ACTIVE
- INVALID_TARGET
- INVALID_ARTIFACT_URI
- CONFLICT
- PERMISSION_DENIED
- RUNNING_READONLY
- INTERNAL_ERROR

---

## 10. Security & Isolation

### 10.1 Sandbox constraints

- All artifacts must live under task-scoped storage.
- Artifact URIs must not permit path traversal.

### 10.2 Access control

At minimum:

- task must be scoped to a user identity (metadata.user_id)
- callers without permission must receive PERMISSION_DENIED

### 10.3 Sensitive data handling

- logs may include model prompts/responses → treat logs as sensitive artifacts
- allow a config option to redact prompt content in event streaming

### 10.4 Authentication mode

- MCP authentication is API-key header based.
- Clients should send `X-API-Key: pex_...` on MCP requests.
- OAuth is not supported for the MCP API.

---

## 11. Performance Requirements

### 11.1 Responsiveness

- task_status must return within < 250ms under normal load.

### 11.2 Large artifacts

- server SHOULD impose max read size per call (e.g., 2–10MB)

---

## 12. Observability Requirements

The server MUST persist:

- run lifecycle events
- stop reasons
- failure tracebacks as artifacts (e.g., run_error.json)
- luigi execution logs (run.log)

---

## 13. Reference UI Integration Contract

To match your UI behavior:

**Progress bars**

Use:

- task_status.progress_percentage
- or progress_updated events

---

## 14. Compatibility & Versioning

### 14.1 Versioning strategy

- MCP server exposes: planexe.version = "1.0"
- breaking changes require major bump

### 14.2 Forward compatibility

Clients must ignore unknown fields and unknown event types.

---

## 15. Testing Strategy

### 15.1 Contract tests (required)

- Start/stop/resume loops
- Invalid transition errors
- Event cursor monotonicity

### 15.2 Determinism tests (recommended)

- Given same inputs + same edits, ensure same downstream artifacts unless models are stochastic
- If models are stochastic, test pipeline correctness, not identical bytes

### 15.3 Load tests (recommended)

- multiple tasks concurrently, one run each
- event streaming stability under heavy log output

---

## 16. Future Extensions (MCP Resources)

PlanExe is artifact-first, and MCP already has a native concept for that: resources. Today artifacts are exposed via download_url or via proxy download + saved_path. Future versions SHOULD expose artifacts as MCP resources so clients can fetch them via standard resource reads (and treat PlanExe as a first-class MCP server rather than a thin API wrapper).

**Proposed resource identifiers**

- planexe://task/<task_id>/report
- planexe://task/<task_id>/zip

**Recommended resource metadata**

- mime type (content_type)
- size (bytes)
- sha256 (content hash)
- generated_at (UTC timestamp)

**Notes**

- Resources can be backed by existing HTTP endpoints internally; the MCP resource read returns the bytes + metadata.
- This enables richer MCP client UX (preview, caching, validation) without custom tool calls.

---

## 17. Future Tools (High-Leverage, Low-Complexity)

The following tools remove common UX friction without expanding the core model.

### 17.1 task_list (or task_recent)

Return a short list of recent tasks so agents can recover if they lost a task_id.

**Notes**

- Default limit: 5–10 tasks.
- Include task_id, created_at, state, and prompt summary.

### 17.2 task_wait

Blocking helper that polls internally until the task completes or times out. Returns the final task_status payload plus suggested next steps.

**Notes**

- Inputs: task_id, timeout_sec (optional), poll_interval_sec (optional).
- Outputs: same as task_status + next_steps (string or list).

### 17.3 task_get_latest

Simplest recovery: return the most recently created task for the caller.

**Notes**

- Useful for single-user / single-session flows.
- Should be scoped to the caller/user_id when available.

### 17.4 task_logs_tail (optional)

Return the tail of recent log lines for troubleshooting failures.

**Notes**

- Inputs: task_id, max_lines (optional), since_cursor (optional).
- Useful when task_status shows failed but no context.

---

---

## Appendix B — Optional v1.1 Extensions

If you want richer Luigi integration later:

- planexe.task.graph (nodes + edges + states)
- planexe.task.invalidate (rerun subtree)
- planexe.export.bundle (zip all artifacts)
- planexe.validate.only (audit without regeneration)
- planexe.task.archive (freeze task)
