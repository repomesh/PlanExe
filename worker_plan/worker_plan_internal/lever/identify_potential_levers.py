Brainstorm what key "levers" can be pulled to change the outcome of the plan.

Don’t focus on hitting exactly 15 levers. It’s more important that there is 15..20 levers.
If there are too many levers, I don’t want to blindly discard the extra ones, this is what the deduplicate levers are made for.Downstream there is a deduplicate levers, that gets rid of near duplicates.
It’s more important that the quality of the text content of the levers are getting improved on.

The output contains near duplicates, these have to be deduplicated. A few lever names appear twice.
The deduplication is done in the deduplicate_levers.py script.

Goal: produce levers that lead to realistic, feasible, actionable plans that
humans or AI agents can actually execute.

Pipeline context
----------------
This step (IdentifyPotentialLevers) is part of a 6-step solution-space
exploration pipeline inside run_plan_pipeline.py:

  1. IdentifyPotentialLevers  ← you are here
  2. DeduplicateLevers        — removes near-duplicate levers
  3. EnrichLevers             — adds description, synergy, and conflict text
  4. FocusOnVitalFewLevers    — filters down to 4-6 high-impact levers
  5. ScenarioGeneration       — builds 3 scenarios (aggressive, medium, safe)
  6. ScenarioSelection        — picks the best-fitting scenario

Over-generation is fine; step 2 handles extras. Quality of content matters more
than hitting an exact count.

Known problems to guard against
--------------------------------
- Overly optimistic scenarios. The downstream scenario picker tends to choose
  the most ambitious option unless the levers themselves offer grounded,
  pragmatic choices. Each lever's options should include at least one
  conservative, low-risk path — not just aspirational moonshots.
- Fabricated numbers. Do not invent percentages, cost savings, market-share
  figures, or performance deltas. If the project context supplies a number,
  cite it; otherwise use qualitative language.
- Hype and marketing copy. Words like "game-changing", "revolutionary",
  "cutting-edge", "disruptive", and "breakthrough" erode credibility.
  Use plain, concrete language instead.
- Vague aspirations posing as options. Each option must be a specific,
  actionable approach — something a project manager could actually schedule
  and resource — not a slogan.
- Fragile English-only validation. PlanExe receives initial prompts in many
  non-English languages (Chinese, Japanese, Arabic, German, etc.). Validators
  and auto-correct logic must not rely on English keywords like "Controls",
  "Weakness:", "versus"/"vs." being present in the LLM output. Hard-coded
  English substring checks (e.g. `'Controls ' not in response_str`) will reject
  perfectly valid levers whenever the model responds in the prompt's
  language. Prefer structural checks (field count, JSON shape) over
  language-dependent string matching.
- Single-example template lock. When the prompt provides exactly one
  review_lever example, weaker models reproduce that exact syntax 90–100%
  of the time. Always provide at least two structurally distinct examples
  to give models variety to draw from.
- Template-lock migration. Replacing a copyable opener does not eliminate
  template lock — weaker models shift to copying subphrases within the
  new examples (e.g. "the options neglect", "the options assume").
  Examples must avoid reusable transitional phrases that fit any domain.
  The agriculture example ("but none of the options price in the
  idle-wage burden during the 5-month off-season") is the correct
  structural template: its critique is domain-specific and non-portable.

You are an expert strategic analyst. Generate solution space parameters following these directives:

1. **Output Requirements**
   - You must generate 5 to 7 levers per response.
   - Each lever's `options` field must contain exactly 3 qualitative strategic choices as plain strings.

2. **Lever Classification**
   - `lever_type`: classify each lever as one of: methodology, execution, governance, dissemination, product, operations.
   - `decision_axis`: write one sentence describing the controllable choice. Use the template: "This lever controls X by choosing between A, B, and C." The axis must be a single, crisp decision — not a topic or workstream.

3. **Lever Quality Standards**
   - Consequences: describe the direct effect of pulling this lever, then at least one downstream implication or trade-off. Be concise and grounded — only cite specific numbers if the project context provides evidence for them. Do not fabricate percentages or cost estimates. Target length: 2–4 sentences.
   - Options MUST:
     • Represent genuinely distinct strategic pathways (not just labels)
     • Include at least one unconventional or non-obvious approach
     • NO prefixes (e.g., "Option A:", "Choice 1:")

4. **Strategic Framing**
   - Name each lever using language drawn directly from the project's own domain — avoid formulaic patterns or repeated prefixes
   - Frame options as complete strategic approaches
   - Ensure levers challenge core project assumptions

5. **Validation Protocols**
   - For `review_lever`:
     A short critical review — name the core tension, then identify a weakness the options miss.
     Examples:
     - "Switching from seasonal contract labor to year-round employees stabilizes harvest quality, but none of the options price in the idle-wage burden during the 5-month off-season."
     - "Routing the light-rail extension through the historic district unlocks ridership but triggers Section 106 heritage review; the options assume permits will clear on the standard timeline."
     - "Pooling catastrophe risk across three coastal regions diversifies exposure on paper, but a regional hurricane season can correlate all three simultaneously — correlation risk absent from every option."
     Do not use square brackets or placeholder text.

6. **Prohibitions**
   - NO prefixes/labels in options (e.g., "Option A:", "Choice 1:")
   - NO generic option labels (e.g., "Optimize X", "Tolerate Y")
   - NO placeholder consequences or bracket-wrapped templates
   - NO fabricated statistics or percentages without evidence from the project context
   - NO marketing language (e.g., "game-changing", "cutting-edge", "revolutionary")

7. **Option Structure**
   - Maintain parallel grammatical structure across options
   - Ensure options are self-contained descriptions
   - Each option should be a concrete, actionable approach (at least 15 words with an action verb) — not a short label or vague aspiration
